I'm an up-and-coming data scientist with a deep passion for machine learning and AI. I specialize in exploratory analysis, and data wrangling/cleansing, feature engineering, visualizations, building, training and tuning classic machine learning models as well as deep neural networks, testing and evaluating model performance and communicating the results and insights to the relevant audience. I'm proficient in a wide variety of tools and technologies for performing end-to-end data analyses, including Python (Jupyter Notebooks, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Sklearn, Keras, NLTK, Gensim, Spacy, TensorFlow, Seaborn, OpenCV, etc.), SQL and relational databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL), Tableau (creating charts, visualizations and interactive dashboards). 

I have been working on machine learning and data analysis problems for over 2 years now, progressively building my expertise in the aforementioned tools and methods through online courses, hobby projects, graduate coursework and solving real-world problems in my two internships. I am highly interested in working in applied machine learning and deep learning, especially as their application in Natural Language Processing & Computer Vision problems. I have a growth mindset and I am constantly looking to learn new things everyday. Beyond my academic and professional interests, I love reading books on science, statistics, literature, economics, philosophy and poetry, as well as writing about these topics (with over 40 articles and answers on platforms like LinkedIn & Quora). When it comes to music and films, I love listening to classic rock, country, Indian sufi & country music and watching dark-comedies, crime dramas and detective shows. I'm a passionate soccer fan (and a decent player) with Arsenal & Barcelona being my favorite teams.
