I'm an up-and-coming data scientist with a deep passion for machine learning and AI. I specialize in exploratory analysis, data wrangling/cleansing, feature engineering, visualizations, building/training/tuning classic machine learning models as well as deep neural networks, testing & evaluating model performance and communicating the results & insights to the relevant audience. I'm proficient in a wide variety of BI tools and technologies for performing end-to-end data analyses, including Python (Jupyter Notebooks, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Sklearn, Keras, NLTK, Gensim, Spacy, TensorFlow, Seaborn, OpenCV, etc.), SQL and relational databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL) and  Tableau (creating charts, visualizations and interactive dashboards). 

I have been working on machine learning and data analysis problems for over 2 years now, progressively building expertise in the aforementioned tools and methods through online courses, hobby projects, graduate coursework and solving real-world problems in my two internships. I am highly interested in working in applied machine learning & deep learning, especially as they are applied in Natural Language Processing & Computer Vision problems. I have a growth mindset and I am constantly looking to learn new things everyday. Beyond my academic and professional interests, I love reading books on science, statistics, literature, economics, philosophy and poetry, as well as writing about these topics (with over 40 articles and answers on platforms like LinkedIn & Quora). I'm also a passionate soccer fan (and a decent player) with Arsenal & Barcelona being my favorite teams.
