I'm an up-and-coming data scientist with a deep passion for machine learning and AI. I specialize in exploratory analysis, and data wrangling/cleansing, feature engineering, visualizations, building, training and tuning classic machine learning models as well as deep neural networks, testing and evaluating model performance and communicating the results and insights to the relevant audience. I'm proficient in a wide variety of tools and technologies for performing end-to-end data analyses, including Python (Jupyter Notebooks, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Sklearn, Keras, NLTK, Gensim, Spacy, TensorFlow, Seaborn, OpenCV, etc.), SQL and relational databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL), Tableau (Reporting, charts & visualizations and interactive dashboards). I have over 2 years of experience working on machine learning and data analysis problems, progressively building my expertise in the aforementioned tools and methods through obnline courses, hobby projects, graduate coursework and solving real-world problems in my two internships. I am highly interested in working in the field of applied machine learning and deep learning, especially its application in Natural Language Processing & Computer Vision.
