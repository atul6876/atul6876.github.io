I have been working on machine learning and data analysis problems for over 3.5 years now, progressively building expertise in the aforementioned tools and methods through online courses, hobby projects, graduate coursework and solving real-world problems in my work experience. I have a growth mindset and I am committed to life-long learning. 

Beyond my academic and professional interests, I love reading books on science, statistics, literature, economics, philosophy and poetry, as well as writing about these topics (with over 40 articles and answers on platforms like LinkedIn & Quora). I love dark comedies and late 70's - early 80's classic rock music.
